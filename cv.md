#### About me


I have worked for more than ten years in the corporate lending department of a commercial bank. Now I have decided to change my profession. I have always loved math and logic puzzles, so programming is very attractive to me. Solving tasks from [codewards.com](https://www.codewars.com/) has become my hobby. I believe that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me become an experienced Frontend Developer.

#### Code example:
KATA from CODEWARS: Write a function that takes a string of parentheses, and determines if the order of the parentheses is valid. The function should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.

    function validParentheses(str) {
        while(str.includes('()')) {
        str = str.replace(/\(\)/g, '');
     }  return str.length===0 ? true : false;
    }
